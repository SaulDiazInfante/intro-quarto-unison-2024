Pre-Work for Python\n\nThis will be a R/RStudio centric course based on the attendees, but we will\nbriefly cover other editors and Python. You are not required to install\nJupyter/Python/VScode, but if you'd like to test them out:\n\n-   Install Python, following instructions at [Minimum Viable\n    Python](https://solutions.rstudio.com/python/minimum-viable-python/installing-python/)\n-   Install\n    [Jupyter](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html#installation)\n-   Install VSCode, [Quarto VSCode\n    extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto),\n    [Python VSCode\n    extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python),\n    [Jupyter VSCode\n    extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-toolsai/jupyter)\n:::\n\n# Overview\n\nThis workshop is designed for those who have no or little prior experience with\nR Markdown and who want to learn Quarto. Quarto is the next generation of\nRMarkdown for publishing, including dynamic and static documents and\nmulti-lingual programming language support. With Quarto you can create\ndocuments, books, presentations, blogs or other online resources.\n\nIn this 2 day workshop you will learn about the Quarto format for technical\ncommunication and computation. We'll teach you how to get started creating and\nfully customizing Quarto outputs (HTML, PDF, Presentations) and the use of\nRStudio's Visual Editor which provides a user interface for editing all of\nPandoc markdown.\n\nWe will also provide an overview of Quarto's developer tooling support in\nalternative tools such as Jupyter, VS Code, and any text editors depending on\nlearner interest.\n\nWe will briefly cover how to generate robust tables/plots in Quarto. Lastly, we\nwill cover Quarto Projects for aggregating many files such as complex web sites\nor entire books.\n\n## Learning objectives\n\n-   Understand the difference between `knitr`, R Markdown, and Quarto\n-   Utilize RStudio, `knitr`, and Quarto to generate static documents,\n    websites/blogs, and presentations\n-   Expand learner's toolkit regarding markdown, CSS, and Quarto-native layout\n    options\n\n> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop at rstudio::conf\n> 2022, but should be useful for self-guided learning as well.\n\n## Is this course for me?\n\nThis two-day workshop is primarily intended as a broad overview of Quarto as the\nnext generation of RMarkdown. You should take this workshop if you have\nexperience programming in R and want to learn how to take advantage of Quarto\nfor literate data science programming in academia, science, and industry.\n\nThis workshop will be appropriate for attendees who answer yes to these\nquestions:\n\n-   Have you programmed in R and want to better encapsulate your code,\n    documentation, and outputs in a cohesive \"data product\"?\n\n-   Do you want to learn about the next generation of RMarkdown for data\n    science?\n\n-   Do you want to have a better interactive experience when writing technical\n    or scientific documents with literate programming?\n\n## Prework\n\nIf you are a workshop attendee and have any trouble with installation locally,\nplease reach out to me directly!\n\n-   Install latest version of RStudio, [`v2022.07.0-548` or\n    later](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\n-   Install [latest version of Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)\n    (`v1.0.36` or greater)\n-   After installing Quarto, open the terminal in RStudio:\n    -   The terminal is located in the tab next to the R console pane in RStudio\n    -   Install/Update `TinyTeX` for PDFs with `quarto install tool tinytex`\n    -   Install/Update Chromium with `quarto install tool chromium`\n-   Ideally upgrade/use to R 4.1 or R 4.2 (I'm showing base R pipe as `|>`)\n-   Install these R packages:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npkg_list <- c(\n  \"tidyverse\", \"gt\", \"gtExtras\", \"reactable\", \"ggiraph\", \"here\", \"quarto\",\n  \"rmarkdown\", \"gtsummary\", \"palmerpenguins\", \"fs\", \"skimr\"\n  )\ninstall.packages(pkg_list)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Workshop Materials\n\nOn Monday morning July 25th - clone/pull this repo (to get latest version)!\n<https://github.com/jthomasmock/quarto-workshop.git>\n:::\n\n## Schedule\n\n### Week 1\n\n| **Date**    | **Time**    | **Activity**                                                      |\n|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Jun-17-2024 | 16:00-15:00 | [Understanding magic with Quarto](materials/01-intro-quarto.html) |\n| Jun-18-2024 | 16:00-15:00 | [Authoring with Markdown and more](materials/02-authoring.html)   |\n| Jun-19-2024 | 16:00-15:00 | [Authoring with Markdown and more](materials/02-authoring.html)   |\n| Jun-20-2024 | 16:00-15:00 | [Computation and Editors](materials/03-computation-editors.html)  |\n| Jun-21-2024 | 16:00-15:00 | [Computation and Editors](materials/03-computation-editors.html)  |\n\n### Week 2\n\n| Date        | Time        | Activity                                                                |\n|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Jun-24-2024 | 16:00-17:00 | [Presentations](materials/05-presentations.html)                        |\n| Jun-25-2024 | 16:00-17:00 | [Websites](materials/06-websites.html)                                  |\n| Jun-26-2024 | 16:00-17:00 | [Advanced plots, tables, and more](materials/07-plots-tables.html)      |\n| Jun-27-2020 | 16:00-17:00 | [Going further with Quarto + `knitr`](materials/08-advanced-knitr.html) |\n| Jun-28-2024 | 16:00-17:00 | [Going further with Quarto + `knitr`](materials/08-advanced-knitr.html) |\n## Instructor\n\nSaul Diaz-Infante, PhD. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png) This work is licensed\nunder a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\nLicense](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n",
